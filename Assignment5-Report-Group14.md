# Introduction
In this lab report, our group analyzed failure data from a hypothetical system using two key methods: Reliability Growth Testing and the Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC). These methods helped us understand how system reliability changes and improves during testing. We used "C-SFRAT" to track failure rates and reliability over time. Since the tool didn’t run properly on the Windows 10 PC that we used, we successfully ran it using **Oracle VM VirtualBox**. This hands-on experience helped us see the importance of reliability testing in real-world scenarios and better understand the tools used in the process.
